            "Okay Kisak. But why do you use Gentoo then?",

            "No time Tycho, we gotta move",
            "He walked over to the light of my monitors and I saw it was Jess, he was carrying a prepubescent girl under each arm.",
            "He then punched out the glass behind where I had been shot and pulled out a Portal gun",
            "One sec he said.",

            "Ehh, not really",
            "Got it! he said and fired into the night sky.",
            "He glanced at his watch for about 10 seconds, then dropped the other girl into the portal.",
            "Our turn, let's go! He fired a shot into the nearest StarBucks, grabbed my wrist and jumped us both down into the portal.",
            "We teleported directly into Starbucks, the barista gave us a weird look, and Jess disabled the portal.",
            "He turned to me, That, ladies and gentlemen, was Portal #3.",
            "We both started to laugh.",
